I am creating my own neovim configuration, this config will be as simple as possible

The nvim version installed is the nightly 0.12 version

I will not be using a package manager like lazy or packer, instead, I will be using the built in pack manager withing nvim

My plan is to have a single init.lua file, as well as 'after' directory with each of the plugins configurations inside.

I have to set up an lsp, and will be setting up the java jdtls as best as I can (java is not easy to set up).
