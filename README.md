I am creating my own neovim configuration, this config will be as simple as possible

The nvim version installed is the nightly 0.12 version

I will not be using a package manager like lazy or packer, instead, I will be using the built in pack manager withing nvim

My plan is to have a single init.lua file, as well as 'after' directory with each of the plugins configurations inside.

I have to set up an lsp, and will be setting up the java jdtls as best as I can (java is not easy to set up).

Anyone is more than welcome to suggest new configuration lines and techniques as long as it's not AI generated.

All these files will be uploaded from my terminal, using 'git' and git commands locally. Some of these files won't make much
sense to more experienced developers but this is a learning curve.
